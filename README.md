# openSenseMap to SensorThings API Adapter
Additional Software to convert the data from the openSenseMap into the SensorThings API format.


This software was created in the context of a Bachelors Thesis.


This repository mostly consits of the already existing code of the [openSenseMap-API](https://github.com/sensebox/openSenseMap-API).


For the adapter to work, two files, staUtils.js and staUrlUtils.js needed to be added, aswell as some new routes and a few confiq details in the default.js. All changes are clearly marked with comments.
